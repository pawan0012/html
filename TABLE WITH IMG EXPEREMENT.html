            The Bentley Continental GT is a luxury sports coupe, engineered for high performance,
             speed, and elegance. Its power comes from a turbocharged V8 or W12 engine, capable of producing 
             anywhere from 500 to over 600 horsepower, allowing it to 
            accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds. The GT offers exceptional handling,
             a refined ride, and advanced technology, making it one of the most powerful and luxurious cars on
              the road. Its power is focused on achieving blistering speeds, smooth acceleration, and a thrilling
               driving experience.
            
            On the other hand, a tractor is a rugged, utilitarian machine designed for work on farms,
             construction sites, or industrial applications. Its power lies in its torque rather than sheer
             
             horsepower, with engines designed to pull heavy loads and work in challenging terrains. While
              a tractor may produce less horsepower—typically ranging from 50 to 500 horsepower—it generates 
              significantly higher torque, which is crucial for plowing fields, towing large machinery, 
              or performing construction tasks. The power of a tractor is designed for endurance, traction, and
               reliability rather than speed.
            
            In summary, the Bentley Continental GT is a powerhouse in terms of speed, luxury, and performance
            , while a tractor is a workhorse, excelling in raw torque, durability, and utility for heavy-duty tasks.
             Both are powerful, but their strengths are suited to entirely different needs and environments
             .</TH>
             <TH>The Bentley Continental GT is equipped
                 with a 6.0-liter W12 engine, which is one of the most powerful an
                 d refined powertrains in the luxury sports car segment, offering exceptional 
                 performance. This engine is not to be confused with a 650cc engine, as the Continental
                 GT's W12 engine is significantly larger and produces far more power. The 6.0-liter W12 
                 engine in the Continental GT typically generates around 626 horsepower and 664 lb-ft of
                  torque, enabling the car to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just around 3.6 seconds. This
                   engine combines cutting-edge turbocharging technology with a sophisticated all-wheel-drive
                    system, providing an exhilarating driving experience while maintaining the luxury and
                     comfort Bentley is known for. Its smooth, refined power delivery, paired with precision
                      engineering, makes the W12 engine in the Continental GT a standout in terms of both 
                      performance and craftsmanship.

             <TH>The beauty of the Bentley Continental GT motorcycle lies in its perfect blend of 
                sophisticated design, powerful performance, and cutting-edge technology. While Bentley is 
                renowned for its luxury cars, if we imagine the essence of the Continental GT translated 
                into a motorcycle, it would undoubtedly embody sleek elegance with muscular appeal. 
                The bike would feature meticulously crafted bodywork, perhaps with a polished chrome frame,
                 fine leather seats, and intricate detailing that speaks to craftsmanship at its finest. Its
                  sleek, aerodynamic lines would echo the smooth, flowing contours of the Continental GT car
                  , while the powerful engine would promise thrilling acceleration, effortlessly combining
                   raw power with refined smoothness. Every detail, from the precision-tuned suspension to
                    the sophisticated riding experience, would reflect Bentley's commitment to luxury and 
                    performance. The Continental GT motorcycle would be a perfect embodiment of opulence, 
                    speed, and modernity, attracting attention with every curve and rev of its engine.



             </TH>,
             <TH>The Bentley Continental GT, as a car, features
                 a potent W12 engine that produces impressive torque, which plays a s
                 ignificant role in its powerful performance and smooth driving experience. While t
                 he Continental GT is not a motorcycle, if we were to imagine a Continental GT bike insp
                 ired by the car, its torque would be similarly remarkable. Torque in the car's W12 engine 
                 reaches around 664 lb-ft, enabling rapid acceleration and a thrilling driving experience.
                  In a hypothetical Continental GT motorcycle, this torque would be translated into superb
                   low-end power, allowing the bike to surge forward with ease and provide exceptional hand
                   ling, even at low speeds. The high torque would ensure a seamless and exhilarating ride,
                    offering a perfect balance of power and control, whether cruising on highways or naviga
                    ting tight corners. The result would be a motorcycle capable of offering a refined yet 
                    adrenaline-pumping performance, much like the car, while maintaining the luxury and cra
                    ftsmanship Bentley is known for.

                 a powerful, distinctive presence, makes it an instant symbol of sophistication. Beneath t

                 he hood, the Continental GT houses a turbocharged W12 or V8 engine, delivering exhilarating
                  acceleration and unmatched power, offering an exceptional driving experience. The car's i
                  nterior, with its hand-stitched leather, polished wood, and state-of-the-art technology,
